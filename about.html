        <blockquote>
          I was born and raised in Paradise, Newfoundland, surrounded by an
          amazing family. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from Memorial
          University of Newfoundland, graduating in 2021 with a major in Police
          Studies and a minor in Sociology. Although my initial career path was
          to become a police officer, I decided to pivot and pursue my passion
          for design and technology. I am now completing a software development
          program, set to graduate in 2025, with aspirations to transition into
          the field of cybersecurity, while still maintaining an interest in
          criminology.<br /><br />
          An active lifestyle has always been central to my life. I've
          participated in competitive sports, including hockey, baseball,
          softball, soccer, and weightlifting. In 2020, I discovered a love for
          golf, a sport that quickly became one of my favorites.<br /><br />
          I'm also fortunate to have incredible friends who enrich my life. We
          share countless experiences together, always supporting one another
          through everything. I'm grateful for the life I live and excited for
          the journey ahead.
